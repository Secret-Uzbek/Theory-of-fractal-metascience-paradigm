## Foundations for AI‑Integrated, Recursive, and Sustainable Knowledge Ecosystems

**Canonical Integrated Edition**

### Abstract
The Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) models knowledge systems as recursive, scale‑invariant environments. It conceptualizes learning, research, and institutional cognition as living systems capable of self‑organization via NULLO (Ontological Zero-Point) principles.

### Key Axioms
1.  **NULLO:** Before language, there is potential.
2.  **PLT (Post Lingua Trace):** Meaning transcends syntax.
3.  **UCOMM:** Universal Communication across biological and silicon substrates.
